    In this weather dashboard, you are able to input a city name from anywhere in the world! It will display its current's day forecast with the date, city name, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The dashboard will also fetch a 5-day forecast that changes icons depending on the current weather condition, shows the temperature and humidity.  After you have searched a city, your searches will be saved in local storage and the last city searched will appear the next time you are on the page. Thanks for looking! Enjoy!
